This is fine
@
The cake is a lie
@
Why so serious?
@
It's over nine thousand
@
I'll be back
@
What are those?
@
Time is money
@
Fortune favors the bold
@
Let there be light
@
All is fair in love and war
@
It's a trap!
@
Brevity is the soul of wit
@
So it goes
@
I'm not a robot
@
Fear is the mind killer
@
I see dead people
@
I am the night
@
Break a leg
@
Better late than never
@
To be or not to be
@
When in Rome
@
Don't eat bats
@
Small wonder
@
Cruel and unusual
@
We the people
@
Fools rush in
@
Don't stop believing
@
To err is human
@
The grass is always greener
@
Wash your hands
@
One small step for man
@
Call me Ishmael
@
I am become Death
@
Curiosity killed the cat
@
There is no spoon
