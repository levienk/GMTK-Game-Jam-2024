It was a bright cold day in April
@
The only thing we have to fear is fear itself
@
The truth is rarely pure and never simple
@
Not all those who wander are lost
@
To live is the rarest thing in the world
@
The unexamined life is not worth living
@
The pen is mightier than the sword
@
I came, I saw, I conquered
@
One fish, two fish, red fish, blue fish
@
Life is short, art is long
@
All is fair in love and war
@
I think, therefore I am
@
With great power comes great responsibility
@
The course of true love never did run smooth
@
I am a leaf on the wind
@
I love the smell of napalm in the morning
@
I reject your reality and substitute my own
@
Necessity is the mother of invention
@
A watched pot never boils
@
A picture is worth a thousand words
@
All that glitters is not gold
@
Beware the Jabberwock, my son!
@
What light through yonder window breaks?
@
We can’t repel firepower of that magnitude!
@
I am a servant of the Secret Fire
@
That’s one small step for man
@
I have measured out my life with coffee spoons
@
I am a part of all that I have met
@
That which does not kill us makes us stronger
